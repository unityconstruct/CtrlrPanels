### How to run these programs.

- Each program needs to be run from within the Ctrlr program itself. Download a copy of 5.3.201 for Windows/Linux or 5.3.198 for MacOS. and load this program into Ctrlr. This can be done from within a DAW too, by loading a panel into the VST version of Ctrlr, which will have been preinstalled into your VST folder.
- 
[1] Go to :: File » Open Panel

VST or STANDALONE INSTANCE
- It is also possible to run these programs as a separate standalone executable or VST .

[1] Open this program from within the Ctrlr program
[2] Go to :: Panel » Panel Mode. Change the height of the panel (See below)
[3] Then go to File -> Export -> Export Restricted Instance.

- Workaround/Bug Fix :: To build as standalone executable on Windows or export as VST, please add 24 pixels to the panel height before exporting. (otherwise you will find the bottom 24 pixels have been truncated).

### Roland JD-990 Sysex Dump Utility
##### July 6, 2018 by dnaldoog
##### Roland JD-990 Sysex Dump Utility
 
- Downloads Internal Patches I-11 – I-88 (64 x patches).
- Can upload sysex files back to the JD-990.
- Features progress bar and cancel button.
- Transfer times can be changed (recommended 360~400ms download and ~150ms upload according to my tests but that may depend on your setup).
- A full dump should be 33216 bytes.  If you get a “MIDI Buffer Full” notice on the JD-990, increase the Transfer Rate.
- Tested in standalone mode only with  [Ctrlr 5.3.201 (Recommended)] ::  Windows 10.
- This program is also included in the JD-990 Super Editor.

- Could this panel be adapted for / used with a Roland AX-7 controller?

- Hi Lloyd,
- I think the code is very specific to the JD-990, but the basic concept should be the same so ‘yes’ but with a lot of work and re-configuring.
- As I don’t have the AX-7 controller, I wouldn’t want to do it, but if you want to try, I can help you if you get stuck somewhere.

- Hi Lloyd. I had a quick look at the manual https://static.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/AX-7_OM.pdf. I don’t think there are any sysex commands you could trigger from a computer to initiate a bulk dump. On page 15 it tells you how to start a dump of the whole machine. You do it from the synth manually.
- I don’t know how much you know about midi dumps (I am still learning) but I think all you would need is a utility like Bome SendSX [ https://www.bome.com/products/sendsx ] or MidiOx [ http://www.midiox.com/ ] to capture the data after it streams all the data off the AX-7 to the computer and save as a file (.syx) on windows.
- You should then be able to re-upload the data in future using either of those two utilities to reverse the process. From what I can see, that is all you really need with that synth.

- Hi there!
- I don’t understand how to open a .bpanelz file. I am under OS X and use Logic Pro 9 and X.
- Thanks in advance.

dnaldoog
- Hi Pevets,
- I don’t know – I only use Windows or Linux.
- But maybe read here for the answer http://ctrlr.org/forums/topic/ctrlr-for-mac-os/

- Hi dnaldoog,
- Thank you, I didn’t have this program. But, now, i don’t know how to use it. )-;

- Hi Pevets,
- What is it you don’t know how to use? Ctrlr or this panel?

Pevets

- Hi dnaldoog,
- First, Ctrlr seems not working under OS X 10.6. But it works under OS X 10.9, with both Logic Pro 9 & X.
- When I press “UPLOAD TO JD-990”, sysex file is sent, but nothing happens into the JD-990 (of course, Internal Protect is off).
- What do not I do correctly?

dnaldoog
- December 14, 2018 at 1:40 pm
- Hi Pevets – is it transmitting the full 33216 bytes and are you getting no Midi Buffer Full errors? You can see the JD-990 Midi Message light flickering on and off, right?
- Have you tried setting the Transfer Rate Delay down to a really slow value like 1500 for example?
- Also MidiOx or Bome SendSX should be able to upload that sysex file too. If they can’t either, then it’s probably not the program but something else.

- Hi dnaldoog,
- Yes, it transmits the full 33216 bytes and I don’t get Midi Buffer Full errors. But I can’t see the JD-990 Midi Message light flickering on and off; nothing happens at all.

- Hi Pevets – It works for me on Windows 10, so I’m not sure what to suggest other than checking cables etc! Unless the problem’s related to the Mac version of Ctrlr?

Pevets
- December 17, 2018 at 3:35 pm
- Hi dnaldoog,
- I will check it, but the cables work with my DAW. I’m afraid the problem’s related to the Mac version of Ctrlr.

Pevets

- Hi dnaldoog,
- Everything works fine in Logic! So, also under OS X. So great!

- Hi
- I have a JD800 can i use this panel also for the JD800 to upload and download sysex?

dnaldoog
- February 16, 2019 at 10:53 am
- Hi Michelk.
- I just looked at the JD-800 manual and the Sysex Implementation is similar in some ways but really completely different, so I would say a definite no unfortunately. I don’t have a JD-800, but when I have time I might try to do that. Private message me if you are interested, but it won’t be for a while as I am working on a new JD-990 panel.

- Hello. Great work indeed!
- Just an issue to start ! I have installed both bulk editor and super editor. Testing the communication by midi cables is OK. I can choose patches in INT, A and B bank but th’e super editor does’nt find my data cart on which I have already copyed som patches from the SR-JV-04 JD mode. Also, I can read the list of patches in the se-jv expansion but impossible to choose a patch and load it in a temp memory to play it.
- In the bulk module, when I press the upper knob on the right to download bulk nothing happens since the display shjows a fantom downlod but after the file is said to empty. the connection is good because if I ask for bulk and start it manually on the jd990, some ddata are coming but too much (more than 6000!= Ok end! Thanks

- I apologize, the place left for the message was at the end. Just to say that I work on Windows 7. Connexion withe a MIDI USB box with 4 slots, the JD is connected on slot 2. I did’nt try to connect it directly yet.
- Thank’s for help. Fabrice, in France.

- Bonjour Fabrice,
- My apologies for not reading this sooner.
- Did you solve the problem or is there still a problem?
- I am not sure I fully understand your message.
