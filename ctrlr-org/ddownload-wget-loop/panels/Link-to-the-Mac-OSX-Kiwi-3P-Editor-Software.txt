Hi,

Here is a link to the Mac OSX Kiwi-3P Editor Software, User Manual and Sysex Files.

It is complete and working and should not require any additional set-up. If you find it useful please drop me an email at lfo2vco@hotmail.co.uk. It would be nice to know that other Kiwi-3P users are getting the benefit of it.
