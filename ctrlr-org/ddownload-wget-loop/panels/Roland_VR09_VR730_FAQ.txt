# General 
#############################################################################

Q: What is the difference between VR09 and VR09*B*?
A: A part from cosmetic changes (colours) there is ZERO difference.
   VR09B is shipped with a newer firmware version,  but VR09 can easily be upgraded.

Q: What is the difference between VR09(B) and VR730?
A: VR730 has a 73 key Waterfall keybed like on 'real Hammonds', is bigger and a bit heavier. 
   VR730 has a couple of (rather uninteresting) additional sounds, some of them are taken from RD2000 but _NO_ RD2000 acoustic piano

Q: Has the VR730 the same keybed as the predecessors VR760 and VR700? 
A: No. VR730 has a 'standard' Waterfall Fatar FP80 used on other clones (Nord Electro, Hammond SK1, Mojo, Viscount, etc)
   The Fatar-feel is ok but in no way comparable to the 'magic' of the VR700/760 keybed

Q: How can I use two sounds (split/dual mode) from the same sound group (e.g. 2 acoustic pianos)?
A: Set split/dual mode with 2 sounds from different groups
   use the dial to select the sound you want to change
   press the sound group button a longer time until the sound menu appears
   select the sound

Q: Are there software editors for the VR09/09B/730?
A: Yes: Roland VR-09 EDITOR (IOS) and CTRLR V-Combo EDITOR (Windows/OSX/Linux)

Q: Does the VR have 'hidden' features or sounds? 
A: Yes, a LOT of them (~1000 sounds, multiple zones and voices, etc). Use CTRLR V-Combo EDITOR to exploit them.

Q: Can I use program change messages to switch VR registrations?
A: The VR CANNOT RECEIVE registration program changes (no, no... and no!)
   The VR CAN SEND registration program changes: see p. 50+51 Roland VR09 reference manual (download from Roland website) 

Q: Can I use program change messages to switch VR patches (sounds)?
A: No. You can send a program change (PC) message to the 'keyboard sound engine, but the result will be aleaoric.
   To switch patches you have to use sysex messages.
   On the other hand, program change messages are well understood by the GM2 sound engine.

Q: What are these 'GM2 sounds' and why can't I access/play them on the VR?
A: The VR has a 2nd sound engine under the hood - the GM sounds. 
   They can be played by:
   - external midi gear (e.g. a 2nd keyboard or software) 
   - running a midi song file from the VR USB-stick
   - directly on the VR by plugging a 5-pin midi cable from VR midi-out to -in and setting the TX channel(s) of each manual 
     to another midi channel (e.g. channel 5 for playing a GM sound on channel 5)
   To select (and customize) GM sounds you can use the GM2 user interface of CTRLR EDITOR or any programmable midi controller

Q: I lost some caps of the VR draw-faders. Where can I buy them? 
A: Eeerrr... good luck!

# VR acoustic pianos 
#############################################################################

Q: The VR pianos do not sound very good. Why? 
   Issues are:
   - Identical samples for damper on and damper off: the piano sound of a real piano is very different if damper is on or off.
     Digital pianos use different samples or sophisticated algorithms when damper is off. The VR simply sustains the 'damped' samples.  
   - No (additional) sympathetic resonance in the undamped sound.
   - A piano note does not only sound louder but also with a different timbre if the key is hit harder. 
     The VR has (only) 5 discrete 'velocity' samples (= different samples relied to the force on the key). 
     The difference between the highest and second highest sample is very pronounced and difficult to control.
     The play becomes 'disjointed' when unvoluntary triggering the highest sample.

Q: Is there a any difference in acoustic pianos between VR09, VR09B, VR730?
A: No. VR730 has been (missleadingly) annonced with 'sounds from Roland RD 2000' but this does NOT include the RD2000 APs!
   A minor improvement on APs came with VR09/730 firmware 1.11 (e.g. 2D effect with bass notes on the left and higher notes
   on the right speaker)

Q: Is there a way to get better piano samples? 
A: No. The VR cannot load samples. But you can use a tablet/computer running a piano app (e.g. Sampletank) that you play through the VR.

Q: Is there a way to improve the VR 'onboard' Grand to sound more like a real Grand?
A: Only in nuances. 
   a) VR 'only': add some 'stage' hall and use the filter to add a bit of resonance 
   b) CTRLR editor: CTRLR editor has a 'V-piano' mode that can be used live (reacts to damper pedal) 
      Depending on damper pedal position, it adds (customizable) amounts of brilliance, 'sympathetic resonance' (in fact
      a special 'hall' setting) etc. 

Q: Is there a way to improve the VR piano to have more grunch for playing in a (rock) band?  
A: Yes, VR users layer 2 APs (e.g. Grand and Rock piano) in dual mode

Q: What stage piano do you recommend to complete my VR? 
A: See 'GEARLIST'

# VR MIDI
#############################################################################

Q: How does the VR handle MIDI? 
A: The VR is 99% based on 'midi system exclusiv' (sysex) messages. 
   It understands only a very few classical control canges (CC) e.g NOTE on/off, modulation (CC1), volume (CC 7), Midi PANIC

Q: Can I control drawbars with an external midi controller or master keyboard?
A: Only with a controller/master that can handle sysex messages (with Roland checksum). See the 'GEARLIST' below

Q: Which hardware controllers/masterkeyboards are recommended for the VR?
A: The parameters of the VR keyboard can only be changed by midi system exclusiv (sysex) messages
   The number of hardware controllers beeing able to handle sysex messages including the Roland checksum is limited:

  *) Midi Controllers (hardware-controller w/o keys) 

    Actually (2020) no such controllers are on the market 
 
    Discontinued (available 2nd hand):
    - Behringer BCF2000 (2011): pots, 8 motor(!)faders, usb
    - Behringer BCR2000 (2011): a lot of pots, no faders, usb
    - Novation ZeRO SL MK1, MK2 (2009) : pots, 8 faders, usb, windows editor
    - CME Bitstream 3X (200?): many pots, 8 faders, Roland checksum with firmware 1.8
    - Doepfer Drehbank (200?): 64 pots, only pots, complicated programming

    NOTE: Behringer BCF/BCR are one of the most versatile controllers ever built. 
          Use freeware 'BC Manager' (MountainUtilities) for Windows/OSX to setup midi, eg. defining the Roland checksum formula

  *) Midi Master Keyboard (hardware-controller with keys) 

     Actually (2020) on the market:
     - Novation SL Mk2 25/49/61: 25, 49 or 61 semiweighted keys, pots, 8 faders, 8 pads
     - Novation SL Mk3 49/61:    49 or 61 semiweighted keys, pots, 8 faders, 8 pads

     Discontinued (available 2nd hand):
     - Novation Remote SL 25/37/61: 25, 37 or 61 semiweighted keys, pots, 8 faders, 8 pads
     - Novation Remote SL COMPACT 25/49:: 25 or 49 semiweighted keys, light variant of the SL, e.g. no faders

Q: I have a hardware/software controller that only handles midi control changes. Is there a way to 'translate' them into system exclusiv?
A: Yes. You can use a computer/tablet with 'mapping software' that you put between the controller and the VR for mapping 
   sysex coming from the VR to the controller. The opposite direction (controller -> VR) is more sophisticated: either the software can
   handle Roland sysex checksum (which generally does not) or a 'mapping rule' has to be created for each single midi value.
  
   Examples for mapping software: 
   CTRLR V-COMBO EDITOR (free): Midi-Mapper section, including Roland checksum handling
   BOME midi translator PRO for Windows and OSX
   BOME midi translator CLASSIC for Windows (free)
   KeyStage for IOS (tablet/smartphone)

Q: What stage/digital piano is recommended to complete my VR?
A: Stagepianogs in the 'market niche' of the VR (max 15kg, max 1000 Euro/USD):

  - Roland GO:Piano: good piano sound, NO HAMMER ACTION, 61 or 88 unweighted but piano-shaped keys, ultra-light (4kg)
  - Casio PX5S: hybrid digital-piano/synth/midi-controller, very good hammer action, nice (a bit 'sharp') sounding pianos,
       hundreds of sounds and customizations, 4 zones, controllers, arp, 6-osc synth, light (11kg) 
  - Casio PX M560: workstation-like, hammer action and grand/piano sound identical to PX5S,
       hundreds of sounds and customizations, 2 zones, rhythms/accompaignment, 6-osc synth, speakers, light (11kg) 
  - Casio PX S1000: hammer action with some issues (like it or hate it), very good grand/piano sound, speakers, light (11kg) 
  - Casio PX S3000: hammer action and piano sound like S1000,
        hundreds of sounds and customizations, 2 zones, rhythms/accompaignment, 6-osc synth, speakers, light (11kg) 
  - Roland FP10: good hammer action, decent 'Roland-sounding' piano, few 'other' sounds, speakers, light (12kg) 
  - Roland FP30: good hammer action, decent 'Roland-sounding' piano, some more 'other' sounds, speakers, not so light (14kg) 
  - Roland RD 88:   good hammer action (like FP), decent 'Roland-sounding' piano,
        some 'other' sounds, 2 zones, limited as controller, speakers, not so light (13,5kg) 
  - Roland RD 64: very good hammer action (like FP80), 64 keys, decent 'Roland-sounding' piano, not so light (13kg)
  - Yamaha P 45: low spec hammer action, rather basic piano sound, speakers, light (12 kg)
  - Yamaha P 125: low spec hammer action, decent 'Yamaha-sounding' piano, speakers, light (12 kg)
  - Yamaha P 121: like P121 but with 73 keys

Q: Can the VR organ be improved using a rotary/overdrive pedal?
A: Yes an no: if it's an improvment depends on your personal taste :)
   Some pedals on the market:
   - NEO Instruments Ventilator II/mini Vent II: THE reference, but very expensive (start thinking to buy a Nord Electro or SK1 instead ...)
   - Electro Harmonix Lester G/Lester K 
   - Nux Roctary (very inexpensive, nice sounding, ca. 60 euro/USD)

Q: Any recommendations for amplifiers/speakers?
A: For realistic grand piano sound, don't use 'keyboard amps' (like Roland KC series) which are designed to pronounce 'synth'-sounds 
   but lack linear frequency response (Behringer KXD 12/15 are said to be quite linear though). Rather go for 2.1 PAs or 'monitors'. 
   If you want realistic grand piano or Leslie sound, REAL stereo is a must (stereo effect of '2-into-1' boxes is lost within one meter range...)
